# Domains for disposable and temporary email addresses

Useful for filtering your email list to increase open rates (sending email to these domains likely will not be opened) or validating an email input against fake adresses.

## Contributing
Feel free to make pull requests or check if there is a pull request that has not been reviewed yet. Every domain should be double-checked once to make sure no provider for real email accounts sneaks into the list.
